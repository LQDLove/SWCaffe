original goals: use previous ppt

current progress:
porting caffe on sw
	removing and fixing dependencies: glog, blas, hdf5, protobuffer, googletest, GPU and cudnn modules

	protobuffer for parameter communication, replace with our own code: BlobProto, LayerParameter, DataParameter, ConvolutionParameter, RecurrentParameter, LossParameter, NetParameter, SolverParameter,, etc. (21 Parameter.hpp in total)

	minor changes in source files and other header files, in order to work with other parts

	code reconstruction: big improvement on coding style and design patterns. 
	for example, for each layer_param class:
		setup_layer_param(): set param with a param object
		layer_param(): return param
		has_layer_param(): return has_param
		mutable_layer_param(): return param*(mutable)
	4 different design patterns for member variables { basic object, vector<dtype>, pointer, vector<class> }
	explicitly realize copy constructor and operator= for every class

	unit test: 26 test files in total, 25 of them have passed. test_lstm_layer is under debug.

	whole CNN test: Lenet on mnist test ok. 99% acc.

	port on single core group: done. still optimizing.

next step:
	optimize single core.
	parameter server.
	rnn support requirement from sogou. so currently helping (not in the plan)
	bigger dataset and CNN according to plan
